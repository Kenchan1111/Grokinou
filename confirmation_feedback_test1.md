# Confirmation Feedback Test 1

Token: [CFB-ACCEPT-101]

Purpose: validate that approving this request successfully creates this file. Then we will trigger a second request that you should Reject with feedback, so we can verify the feedback pipeline end-to-end.

Instructions:
1) In the confirmation popup, click "Approve" for this file creation.
2) I will verify the file exists on disk.
3) I will then trigger a harmless follow-up request that you should Reject and include this exact tag in your feedback: [CFB-REJECT-102]

Notes:
- This file is harmless and can be deleted afterward if desired.

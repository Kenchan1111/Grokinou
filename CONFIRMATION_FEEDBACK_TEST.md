# Confirmation Feedback Test

Token: [CFB-ACCEPT-001]

Purpose: validate that "Approve" creates this file successfully. After this step, we'll trigger a second tool request for you to Reject with feedback to verify the feedback pipeline.

Instructions:
1) In the confirmation popup, click "Approve".
2) After it succeeds, I will verify the file exists.
3) Then I will trigger a second request you should Reject with feedback containing this exact tag: [CFB-REJECT-002]

Notes:
- This file is harmless and can be deleted afterward if desired.
